# LiftDay

A minimal PWA for tracking Push/Pull/Legs workouts. No account, no cloud, no bullshit — just open it and lift.

**[liftday.vercel.app](https://liftday.vercel.app)**

## What it does

- 6-day PPL split (Push/Pull/Legs × 2, Sunday rest)
- Progressive overload: targets auto-increase when you max out sets
- Week 1–4: 2 sets · Week 5+: 3 sets
- Rest timer with background notification when you switch apps
- 5-minute mobility flow on rest days
- Training history + personal records
- Works offline, installs as a PWA
